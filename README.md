3. **Brand Selection**: Users can choose from seven different categories, including Technology and Electronics, Automotive, Fashion and Apparel, Food and Beverage, Retail and E-commerce, Entertainment and Media, and Cosmetics and Beauty.

4. **Add Product**: A secure private route allows users to add products effortlessly. The form includes essential details such as image, name, brand name, type, price, short description, and rating.

5. **Product Details**: Brands redirect users to dedicated pages where they can explore products in depth. Each brand page offers a slider with advertisements and at least four products, providing crucial product information.

6. **Product Details**: On the detailed product pages, users can find extensive information about the product. An "Add to Cart" button simplifies the purchase process.

7. **My Cart**: Users can manage their added products in the My Cart page. The feature includes the ability to remove products. The design is flexible and open to customization.

8. **Update Products**: The "Update" button allows users to access a form page for modifying product details, including image, name, brand name, type, price, and rating.
